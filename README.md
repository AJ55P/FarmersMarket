# :corn: :potato: :tomato: Farmer's Market :honeybee: Server Side!

### **Description:**

Happy Saturday, Wednesday, or whatever day it is, because here I have a website for a farmer's market, specially made for getting access to fresh, farmer's own grown produce, fish, poultry, and more ! 
\
\
This website features a gui for showing the categories and items available at potentially, ideal farmer's market, along with gui needed for the future clients to select how much of each to purchase.
\
\
It's not a complete project, however, it contains the general essentials needed for the complete application, when following the MVC architecture, such as the view and part of the controller functionality.
\
\
*In conclusion, this project showcases the effectiveness of using templates(Nunjucks.js) for implementing this sort of website, on the server side !* Thanks for stopping by.
