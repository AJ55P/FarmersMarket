# :corn: :potato: :tomato: Farmer's Market :honeybee: Server Side!

### Live Deployment on Heroku: <a href="https://farmers-market-app1.herokuapp.com/">https://farmers-market-app1.herokuapp.com/</a>

### **Description:**

Happy Saturday, Wednesday, or whatever day it is, because here I have a website for a farmer's market, specially made for getting access to fresh, farmer's own grown produce, fish, poultry, and more ! 
\
\
This website features a gui for showing the categories and items available at a potentially, ideal farmer's market, along with a simple gui needed for the future clients to select how much of each to purchase.
\
\
I chose to use the nunjucks template engine, and, soon found out how well this tool works when building these types of sites. First, I just built the base template, and utilizing the handy features such as: built-in tags(for loop), variable substitution, template inheritance, made it flexible and gave me a lot of control over the markup of the page. It also helps that the template syntax is a combination of programming language and html.
\
\
It's not a complete project, however, it contains the general essentials needed for the complete application, when following the MVC architecture, such as the view and part of the controller functionality.
\
\
*In conclusion, this project showcases the effectiveness of using templates(Nunjucks.js) for implementing this sort of website, on the server side !* Thanks for stopping by.
